# Text-Claener
"This is a small project aimed at addressing the troubles we encounter when copying text from PDFs and pasting it into Word, Google Translate, etc. You can copy the text from a PDF, paste it into the first box, click the 'Clean Text' button, and then you'll have the cleaned text. The cleaned text will also be copied to your clipboard. You can download the executable (exe) file from the releases. Enjoy using it."
